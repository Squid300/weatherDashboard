  ## Description  
  This homework was creating a weather dashboard using a third party API. The specific API used was openweather and local storage was used to store the data retrieved from the API.

  The exact criteria were as follows:
    ```
    GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    WHEN I search for a city
    THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
    WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
    WHEN I view the UV index
    THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
    WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
    THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
    WHEN I click on a city in the search history
    THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
    ```
